## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform that allows you to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. It helps developers ship their code faster, ensuring that it runs the same on every system.

---

## Docker Hub

Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry where Docker images are stored. You can find pre-built images for various applications or upload your own.

---

## Docker Images

A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including code, runtime, libraries, and environment variables.

**Docker Image Commands:**
- docker images: Lists all Docker images on your system.
- docker pull <image_name>: Downloads a Docker image from Docker Hub.
- docker rmi <image_id>: Removes a specific Docker image from your system.

---

## Common Docker Commands

1. **Run a Container:**
   docker run [options] <image_name>

   Options:
   - -d: Run the container in detached mode.
   - -p: Publish a container’s port to the host (e.g., -p 8080:80).
   - --name: Assign a name to the container.
   - -v: Mount volumes from the host to the container.
   - -e: Set environment variables.
   - -i: Run the container in interactive mode.
   - -t: Allocate a pseudo-TTY.

2. **Exec into a Running Container:**
   docker exec -it <container_name> /bin/bash

3. **List Running Containers:**
   docker ps

4. **Inspect a Container:**
   docker inspect <container_name>

5. **Stop and Remove Containers:**
   docker stop <container_name>
   docker rm <container_name>

6. **Remove an Image:**
   docker rmi <image_name>

---

## Docker Tags

Tags are used to identify different versions of a Docker image.

**Common Tags:**
- -p: Publish ports.
- -v: Mount volumes.
- -t and -i tags can be used in combination to interact directly with the container as if it were a terminal.
- -e: Set environment variables.
- -d: Run in detached mode.
- -a: Attach to the container's STDOUT.

---

## Creating Your Own Docker Image

To create your own Docker image, you need a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile contains a series of instructions for Docker to build the image.

1. **Create a Dockerfile:**

   FROM ubuntu:latest
   
   ENV APP_HOME /app
   
   RUN mkdir $APP_HOME
   
   COPY . $APP_HOME
   
   WORKDIR $APP_HOME
   
   CMD ["python", "app.py"]

2. **Build the Docker Image:**
   docker build -t myapp .

3. **Run the Image as a Container:**
   docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name myapp_container myapp

---

## Environmental Variables

Environmental variables can be passed to containers using the -e flag in the docker run command.

**Example:**
docker run -e VAR_NAME=value -d <image_name>

In Dockerfiles, you can also define environment variables using the ENV instruction:

   ENV VAR_NAME=value
# Docker Compose and Overview

A concise reference guide to simplifying Docker container management using Docker Compose.

## Simplifying with Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool used to define and manage multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to configure your application’s services in a single `docker-compose.yml` file and manage them together, making it easier to build,and run multiple containers.

## Key Concepts:
- **Service**: A container that is part of your application (e.g., web server, database).
- **Volume**: A way to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers.
- **Network**: A way to define how containers communicate with each other.

## Example `docker-compose.yml`:
The contents of yaml file should be in the following format:

      version: '3'
      services:
        web:
          build: .
          ports:
            - "5000:5000"
          volumes:
            - .:/app
          environment:
            - FLASK_ENV=development
        redis:
          image: "redis:alpine"

## Common Docker Compose Commands:
# Docker Compose Commands

## 1. `docker-compose up`
Starts up the containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## 2. `docker-compose down`
Stops and removes all containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## 3. `docker-compose ps`
Lists the containers defined in the Compose file.

## 4. `docker-compose logs`
Displays the logs for services defined in the Compose file.

## 5. `docker-compose start`
Starts existing containers for a service.

## 6. `docker-compose stop`
Stops running containers for a service.
