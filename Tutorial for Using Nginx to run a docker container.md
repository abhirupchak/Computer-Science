# Pull Nginx Image from Dockerhub and Use it to run container

## Step 1: Pull Nginx and run a container named docker-nginx
 Run the following command(always use sudo in front of commands using docker)
   
       docker pull nginx
       docker run --name docker-nginx -p 80:80 nginx

## Step 2: Try loading the public IP address
 Try loading the ip address but remove the  https:// part from the address you should be able to view the default nginx web server page.
 In your terminal, enter CTRL+C to stop the container from running as it is currently attached to your terminal.
     
## Step 3: Remove the container
Enter the following command to remove the container as docker cannot run multiple docker containers using the same image.

     docker rm docker-nginx
## Step 4: Building a Web Page to Serve on Nginx
Create a new directory for your website content within the home directory:

    mkdir -p ~/docker-nginx/html
Navigate into to it by running this command:

    cd ~/docker-nginx/html
Create an HTML file to serve on your server:

    vim index.html
Press i to enter insert mode and insert this html content:

    <html>
      HI
    </html>
Now press Shift and type :wq and press enter to exit.

## Step 5 â€” Linking the Container to the Local Filesystem:
To do this, use the -v flag to map the ~/docker-nginx/html folder from your server to a relative path in the container/usr/share/nginx/html with this command:

    docker run --name docker-nginx -p 80:80 -d -v ~/docker-nginx/html:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx
## Step 6 - Now load the Public IP again:
Again remove the https:// part from the address and you should be able to see the HI html webpage.
